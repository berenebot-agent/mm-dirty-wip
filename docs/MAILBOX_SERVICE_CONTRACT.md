# Mailbox service contract

Status: **implemented.** This document is the interface contract the common
mailbox surface (local/domain and remote/standalone) implements and that the
workflow, HTTP/API and UI layers depend on. It records the shared model, the
per-backend ownership, and the honest limits of the remote index. SQLite's exact
schema is described by the migrations; this file describes behaviour.

Authoritative tree: `repo/`. Every path below is relative to `repo/`.

### Google extension (D098)

Standalone Google inboxes use the same `RemoteMailboxService` and canonical
HTTP/UI surface. The IMAP-specific descriptions below apply to IMAP bindings;
Google uses `internal/transport/gmail`, encrypted per-inbox OAuth grants and
opaque provider message/thread IDs. Migration 059 adds the binding, OAuth-attempt,
ID mapping, native label-membership and independent detection-cursor tables.
Google messages have one cache row and multiple label memberships; `folder_path`
is an internal `gmail:<provider-id>` storage locator, while public folder views
project Gmail system labels or user-label IDs. `ARCHIVE` is a derived view.
Read/star/label/archive/trash operations execute live, as do send, raw/attachment
reads and native draft creation. Metadata backfill is progressive and History API
updates catch up external changes; API list reads synchronize, UI navigation
schedules synchronization. Search uses string continuation tokens (including
within-page position) rather than the IMAP UID continuation. Permanent deletion
and remapping Google's system roles return unsupported. See `docs/GOOGLE.md`.

## 1. Domain model (`internal/model`)

### Inbox kinds — `internal/model/mailbox.go`
- `InboxKindDomain = "domain"`, `InboxKindStandalone = "standalone"`.
- Immutable after creation; the store rejects any change (`store.ErrKindImmutable`).

### `model.Inbox` (`internal/model/model.go`)
- `Kind string` — one of the two kinds above.
- `DomainID string` — empty for a standalone inbox; `NULL` in the database.
- `LocalPart string` — empty for standalone; the address is self-contained.
- `Address string` — the full primary address for both kinds.
- `Namespace string` — the selected remote root (an explicit IMAP folder path)
  for standalone; the scope of every remote operation. The default is `INBOX`.
- `Remote *RemoteConnection` — non-secret remote binding description.
- `RemoteConfigured bool` — whether encrypted remote credentials are present.
- `RemoteSentCopyEnabled bool` / `RemoteSentCopyFolder string` — the standalone
  Sent-copy switch and its optional explicit destination.
- `Capabilities *Capabilities` — populated on retrieval.

### Namespaces and folder scope — the INBOX default is the personal namespace
- The default root (`NamespaceDefault = INBOX`, or an empty namespace) resolves
  to the server's **personal namespace** as discovered by the IMAP `NAMESPACE`
  command: the personal prefix and everything under it. When the server reports
  a non-empty personal prefix, only that prefix and its children are in scope.
- **Shared and Other-users namespaces are always excluded**, whatever the
  personal prefix — even when the personal prefix is empty (INBOX at the top
  level). The adapter records the server's `Other` and `Shared` namespace
  prefixes as exclusions and rejects any path under them first, so a single
  personal mailbox never mirrors or reaches a shared/upstream namespace.
- **When `NAMESPACE` is unsupported (or reports no personal descriptor)** there is
  no discoverable personal boundary, so the scope is deliberately **conservative**:
  only the explicit selected root (the default `INBOX`) and its children, never
  the whole login. An empty prefix is therefore not treated as "everything".
- An **explicit custom root** (any other folder path) is a strict root: it scopes
  the inbox to that folder **and its children only**. A path outside it is not
  addressable. This is the fallback when the server exposes no personal
  namespace, and the way to point an inbox at a single non-INBOX folder.
- Enforcement lives in the IMAP adapter's `RootScope.InScope`
  (`internal/transport/imap/adapter.go`, resolved in `folders.go`) for discovery,
  and in `RemoteMailboxService.folderInScope`
  (`internal/app/remote_mailbox_ops.go`) for every remote read and mutation.
- **Setup note / limitation:** the connector setup UI accepts a "sync root"
  namespace. A blank value means the personal namespace; a non-blank value is a
  literal folder path used as a strict root. On a server whose personal namespace
  is genuinely top-level (empty prefix) the conservative fallback still scopes to
  `INBOX` and its children unless the operator enters an explicit root, so a
  top-level sibling folder on such a server must be reached by setting that root
  (or mapping it by role via the connection-settings page).

### Common types — `internal/model/mailbox.go`
- `Folder{ID, AccountID, InboxID, Path, Name, ParentPath, Role, MessageCount,
  UnreadCount, Selectable, IsSystem, RoleLocked, Origin, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt}`
  — a folder is an explicit member of the inbox's single selected root; `Path`
  is the stable opaque hierarchical locator relative to the root. Roles are
  `FolderRole*` constants (`folder`, `inbox`, `sent`, `drafts`, `trash`, `spam`,
  `archive`, `outbox`, `label`). `Origin` is `local` (owned by the account:
  seeded system or operator-created) or `remote` (mirrored from the provider).
  `IsSystem` marks a protected seeded folder; `RoleLocked` marks an explicit
  operator role mapping that a reconcile must never re-infer. Folders are
  **not** aliases or labels: managed aliases belong to inboxes and labels are
  free-text message metadata, both independent of the folder tree.
- `RemoteLocator{FolderPath, UIDValidity, UID, MessageID}` — the remote routing
  address. `Empty()` reports a local record. A locator is valid only while its
  `UIDValidity` still matches the folder.
- `RemoteConnection{Host, Port, Username, Security, SMTP *RemoteSMTP}` and
  `RemoteSMTP{Host, Port, Username, Security}`. Security is `RemoteSecurityTLS`
  (implicit, default), `RemoteSecurityStartTLS`, or `RemoteSecurityPlain`.
  Plaintext is an **explicit operator choice**, never an automatic downgrade;
  there is no runtime fallback from a stronger to a weaker mode. A self-hosted
  deployment may refuse it (see the UI warnings and `docs/SELFHOSTING.md`).
- `Capabilities{...}` with `DomainCapabilities()` / `StandaloneCapabilities()`
  (`StandaloneCapabilities` sets `Sync=true`; `Outbound` is refined per inbox to
  whether an SMTP binding exists).
- `ListEnvelope[T]{Items, NextCursor, Completeness, Errors []InboxFailure}` —
  the common listing shape. `Completeness` describes whether the source could
  enumerate the whole result set and is **independent of pagination**: having a
  `NextCursor` does not make a listing "partial". `Errors` carries per-inbox
  failures (`model.InboxFailure{InboxID, Code, Message, Retryable}`, built via
  `NewInboxFailure`) so a multi-inbox listing can report one failure without
  failing the whole request; failures expose only the normalized `ErrKind*` code
  and a short safe message, never raw provider or store error text.
- `MailboxError{Kind, Message, Retryable, Cause}` with `NewMailboxError` and the
  `ErrKind*` vocabulary. Provider and store failures map onto it so workflow
  code never inspects a native error.

## 2. Persistence (`internal/store`)

The schema is defined by migrations `052` (additive standalone foundation and
the shared `inbox_folders` table) through `058`. Later migrations are additive
and never rewrite a historical migration's SQL. Key tables:

- `inboxes` — `kind`, `address`, `namespace`, `remote_*`, `smtp_*`,
  `remote_configured`, `remote_sent_copy_enabled`, `remote_sent_copy_folder`,
  `authoring_mode`, `notify_default_address`, and the remote index state
  (`remote_index_status/remote_indexed_at/remote_index_error`).
- `inbox_folders` — the single folder table for BOTH inbox kinds: `path`, `name`,
  `parent_path`, `role`, `selectable`, `is_system`, `origin`, `role_locked`,
  `remote_uid_validity`, `remote_indexed_at`, and opaque `remote_metadata_json`.
- `messages.mailbox_id` — a message's single folder membership; `NULL` is the
  implicit system Inbox bucket.
- `inbox_remote_credentials` — the encrypted IMAP and optional SMTP secrets
  under `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- `inbox_remote_messages` (header/thread metadata cache only), `inbox_remote_labels`,
  `inbox_remote_cursors`, `inbox_remote_arrivals`, `inbox_remote_notifications`,
  `inbox_remote_actions`, `remote_sent_copies`, `assistant_handling_requests`,
  and the durable `pending_file_cleanup` queue.

### Folder and message membership (`internal/store/folders.go`)
- A message is in exactly one folder (`MoveMessageToFolder`); a move emits a
  durable `message.folder_changed` event. `EnsureSystemFolders` seeds the
  protected system folder set (Inbox, Sent, Drafts, Archive, Outbox, Spam,
  Trash) lazily per inbox of either kind.
- `SetFolderRole` maps an existing folder (possibly an arbitrarily-named remote
  folder such as "Old Mail") to a role and persists `role_locked=1`, so a later
  reconcile never resets it by re-inferring the role from the name. Roles map to
  at most one folder. A seeded system role is asserted, never reassigned.

### Standalone CRUD and remote input (`internal/store/standalone.go`)
- `CreateStandaloneInbox`, `ListStandaloneInboxes`, `SetInboxKind` (idempotent
  else `ErrKindImmutable`), `UpdateStandaloneRemote`, `SaveRemoteCredentials`,
  `GetRemoteCredentials`, `UpsertFolders`, `ListFolders`, `GetFolder`,
  `UpsertRemoteMessage`, `GetRemoteMessage`, `GetRemoteMessageByUID`,
  `ListRemoteMessages`, `DeleteRemoteMessage`, `SetRemoteSentCopy`.
- Validation helpers: `ValidateStandaloneAddress`, `FolderRoleForName`.
- `inbox_folders` / `inbox_remote_messages` operations return
  `ErrStandaloneRequired` when the inbox is a domain inbox.

### Sending (`internal/store/sending.go`)
External aliases are removed, so sending has one target shape per kind:
- `SendingTarget{DomainID string}` — the managed domain whose connector sends
  (domain inbox), resolved through `ResolveSendingTarget` /
  `SendingConfigForTarget` / `SendingConfigForMessage`.
- `SendingTarget{InboxID string}` — a standalone inbox's own remote SMTP
  binding, resolved through the injected `StandaloneSenderResolver`
  (`SetStandaloneSenderResolver`). When no resolver is installed the
  configuration is `ErrNoProvider`, so a standalone message is **queued and
  held** rather than attributed to a domain that does not exist.
- `resolveSendingTargetQuery` resolves a requested sender to the inbox primary
  or a managed `inbox_aliases` entry only (a standalone inbox sends as its own
  connected address only). A standalone request for any other sender is
  `ErrSenderNotAllowed`.

## 3. Application boundary (`internal/app`)

### Router, capability surface and config (`internal/app/mailbox_service.go`)
- `MailboxBackendKind` — `BackendLocal` (domain) / `BackendRemote` (standalone).
- `MailboxRoute{Inbox, Backend, Capabilities, Remote}`.
- `MailboxRouter` — `NewMailboxRouter` / `Route` / `RouteInternal` /
  `CapabilitiesOf` / `RemoteLocatorFor` / `BackendFor`. One store read, no
  remote I/O.
- `StandaloneMailboxService` — `CreateStandalone` (account **Admin** only),
  `ListStandalone`, `GetStandalone`, `ReconcileFolders`, `ListFolders`.
- `mapStoreError` normalizes store errors to `*model.MailboxError`.
- `ErrRemoteNotBound` / `ErrLocalOnly`.
- The `MailboxBackend` interface (`Kind`, `Capabilities`, `ListFolders`) and its
  `LocalBackend`/`RemoteBackend` implementations remain a thin capability
  surface. The full live remote implementation is `RemoteMailboxService` below;
  production dispatch happens in `internal/httpapp/mailbox_access.go`, which
  resolves an inbox to its backend once and routes every read/mutation.

### Live remote surface (`internal/app/remote_mailbox.go`,
`remote_mailbox_ops.go`, `remote_mailbox_more.go`)
`RemoteMailboxService` opens a bounded IMAP session per operation, caches only
header/thread/folder metadata, and answers the live operations:
- **Configuration:** `ConfigureStandaloneRemote` (non-secret fields plus
  encrypted secrets; a blank secret retains the stored one), `TestStandaloneRemote`
  (authenticate + resolve folder scope + optional SMTP AUTH check, no mailbox
  mutation), `ResolveRemote`, `InstallRemoteBridges`.
- **Folders:** live `DiscoverFolders`, `CreateRemoteFolder`,
  `RenameRemoteFolder`, `DeleteRemoteFolder` (refuses a non-empty folder),
  `SetRemoteFolderRole`.
- **Messages:** `ReconcileRemote`, `ListRemoteMessages`, `GetRemoteMessage`
  (best-effort live header refresh, never marks seen), `FetchRemoteRaw` /
  `FetchRemoteAttachment` (streamed to a transient temp file, bounded by the
  message-size cap, **never archived**), `SetRemoteRead`, `SetRemoteFlagged`,
  `MoveRemoteMessage`, `PurgeRemoteMessage` (UID-targeted `UID EXPUNGE`, owner
  only, only from the Trash-role folder), `ResolveRemoteReply`,
  `ResolveRemoteForward`.
- **The common single-message GET returns the live body, or `503`.**
  `GET /v1/inboxes/{id}/messages/{messageId}` hydrates the body live (fetch +
  parse, never archived), so a remote read matches a local read. There is **no
  offline/degraded fallback**: if the connector is unreachable or the body cannot
  be parsed, the request answers `503`, rather than silently serving cached
  metadata. List reads stay metadata-only.
- **Threads and search:** `ListRemoteThreads`, `GetRemoteThread`, `SearchRemote`,
  `ListRemoteLabels`, `SetRemoteLabels` / `AddRemoteLabels` / `RemoveRemoteLabels`.
- **Sending / copies:** `RemoteStandaloneSender.ResolveInboxSendingConfig` (the
  injected `StandaloneSenderResolver`), `RemoteHandoffPublisher` (append the
  frozen draft to the remote Drafts folder and verify),
  `RemoteSentCopyPublisher` + `CopyPendingSentCopies` (a durable queue copying a
  sent message into the remote Sent folder; it never re-sends). The copy job
  **owns an independent frozen copy of the raw MIME** for its whole lifetime, so
  trashing and purging the outbound message before the copy settles cannot make a
  pending/ambiguous copy unverifiable.

### Remote index completeness (honest limits)
`ReconcileRemote` refreshes the folder tree and each selectable folder's header
index **progressively**. Every pass refreshes the newest `remoteNewestRefresh`
(500) messages so recent mail and flag changes are current, and advances a
**persisted per-folder backfill cursor** (`inbox_folders.backfill_before_uid` /
`backfill_complete`) downward by one bounded batch of
`DefaultRemoteReconcileLimit` (2000) messages. A folder larger than one batch is
therefore **eventually indexed in full over successive passes — it is not
permanently truncated**. The persisted cursor is scoped to the folder's
UIDVALIDITY; a UIDVALIDITY change resets it.

The index `status` (`never_started`, `partial`, `complete`, `error`) is recorded
on the inbox and exposed via `GET /v1/inboxes/{id}/remote/refresh` and the
remote-config view. It is `partial` while any selectable folder's backfill has not
reached the bottom (or a pass was interrupted / a provider error occurred), and
`complete` only once every folder's backfill has reached the bottom. A scoped
read reconciles on demand when its cached view is stale, and paging through older
mail also drives one backfill batch so old mail is never permanently hidden.

**Hard ceiling — a distinct, honest limit:** the reconcile holds the folder's
**complete UID set** in memory to prune removals safely. That set is capped at
`remoteUIDSetCap = 500000` UIDs (four bytes each). A folder whose UID set exceeds
this cap is **not snapshotted in full**: the pass indexes the newest window only,
**skips prune**, and does **not** advance the backfill cursor or claim
completeness (the cursor is relative to the full set, which it does not have). Such
a folder remains `partial` and is never falsely reported done. This is not the
normal case — ordinary folders (even large ones) backfill progressively to
`complete`; the 500k UID cap is the extreme-size guard.

Removals are pruned only against a **complete** UID snapshot (`fullKnown`); a
partial or windowed view never deletes cached mail.

### Quick new-mail index and the quiescent fast-path
Detection (`RemoteWorker.detectInbox`) records durable arrivals and, for a
standalone inbox, also **quick-indexes** the new INBOX UIDs' headers into the read
index (`inbox_remote_messages`) in the same pass, so new mail appears in the inbox
list immediately rather than waiting for the next deep reconcile. This is the
standard client "fetch only new" behaviour; the deep reconcile later upserts the
same rows in place.

Once a folder's backfill has reached the bottom, `indexRemoteFolder` runs a
**quiescent fast-path**: a single `STATUS` read establishes that the folder's
highest cached UID and cached message count both match the live mailbox (so
neither a new arrival nor a mid-folder deletion occurred), and then only the
flag state is refreshed. When the server advertises CONDSTORE and the folder has
a stored modification sequence, that refresh is an incremental
`FLAGS CHANGEDSINCE` fetch (the stored `inbox_folders.remote_highest_modseq` is
advanced); otherwise the newest window is re-fetched (one bounded newest-first
SEARCH plus a header fetch). The full UID snapshot, prune and backfill batch are
skipped. A new arrival or a deletion moves the max UID or the count and falls
through to the full pass.

### Sync cadence (per-inbox) and the manual refresh
Each standalone inbox carries two optional overrides (`inboxes.remote_poll_seconds`,
`inboxes.remote_full_sync_minutes`; NULL inherits the process default, clamped to
the model minimums). The quick interval governs the fallback poll when the server
does not advertise IDLE; IDLE-capable servers still deliver new mail instantly.
The full interval governs how often the deep reconcile runs (previously the worker
re-ran it roughly every minute). Both are set on the inbox Identity tab's remote
section.

`POST /ui/inboxes/{id}/sync` is the toolbar's square reload button. It runs the
fast new-mail detection/index, re-syncs the headers of the messages currently on
screen (so read/flag changes show immediately), schedules the deep reconcile in
the background, and redirects back to the same view. It requires only Read on the
inbox (it performs no remote mutation) and is shown to every user on a standalone
inbox.

### Assistant handling modes, drafts, notify (`internal/app/draft_workflow.go`,
`draft_handoff.go`, `remote_worker.go`, `control.go`)
- **`MailMooseApproval`** (a domain inbox's preset and default): the in-product
  approval workflow; the approval email carries the one-time token and the frozen
  `From`.
- **`RemoteDraft`** (a standalone inbox's default): a one-way handoff that
  appends the frozen draft to the connected remote Drafts folder. MailMoose
  never sends it. A handoff notification (carrying the correlation header, no
  token) tells the human a draft is waiting.
- The mode is snapshotted onto each request at creation, so an inbox setting
  change never affects an in-flight request. A standalone inbox can be switched
  to `MailMooseApproval` (its approver identity is matched against the message
  `From`; see the accepted risk below). `RemoteDraft` is a standalone-only mode:
  a domain inbox cannot be set to it (the write is rejected, and a legacy domain
  row stored as `remote_draft` normalizes back to the kind default on read), and
  `requestRemoteDraft` requires `kind=standalone` and a mapped remote Drafts
  folder.
- **Notify**: defaults to the inbox's own connected address, with an optional
  per-inbox override, snapshotted per submitted request.
- **Publication, notification and Sent-copy are separate state machines.** A
  handoff's publication state (`pending`/`published`/`ambiguous`/`failed`) is
  independent of its notification state; the Sent-copy is a separate durable job
  that never re-runs the SMTP send. Publication never claims guaranteed
  exactly-once: an append whose result cannot be verified is `ambiguous`, not a
  blind retry.
- **A handoff's outcome is exposed on the Draft response and in a history
  listing.** `model.Draft.Handoff` (`AssistantHandlingRequest`) carries the
  immutable handoff id plus the publication and notification states, populated on
  draft retrieval (`internal/store/drafts.go`), and `GET
  /v1/inboxes/{id}/handoffs` lists the inbox's handoffs newest first, **retaining
  terminal records** (`published`, `ambiguous`, `failed`/`cancelled`) even after
  the local draft has been cleaned up. The handoff events
  (`draft.handoff_requested`/`_published`/`_ambiguous`/`_failed`/`_cancelled`/
  `_notification_sent`/`_notification_failed`) carry the same non-secret fields.
- **Cancel and retry are explicit, bounded, and never automatic.** A **pending**
  or **ambiguous** handoff can be **resolved** (`Store.CancelHandoff` / the UI
  action): it becomes `failed` with `last_error="cancelled"`, the draft returns
  to editable, and a `draft.handoff_cancelled` event is emitted. Allowing an
  ambiguous handoff to be resolved gives the operator an exit so its frozen draft
  is not trapped. An already-`published` handoff cannot be cancelled (`409`). A
  **retry** (UI `retry-handoff`) is a deliberate **re-request** that routes
  through the inbox's effective authoring mode (`RequestSend`), so it only
  produces a new handoff while the inbox is in `remote_draft` mode; it never
  re-appends blindly. In particular, an `ambiguous` append — one whose outcome
  could not be verified — is **never automatically retried**; the human resolves
  or re-requests it. A **transient verification failure** (a lookup error after
  an unconfirmed append) is *not* terminal: the handoff stays pending and the next
  pass re-verifies by lookup (never a blind re-append), bounded by
  `maxHandoffAppendAttempts`. A definitive not-found with no other copy is
  ambiguous; more than one remote match is ambiguous. A retry of a missing frozen
  file verifies by lookup instead of re-appending different bytes.
- **Effective-mode controls.** `GET /v1/inboxes/{id}/authoring` reports the
  effective `mode`, the kind `default_mode`, the notify override, whether the
  inbox `standalone`, and `approver_enabled` — which is true exactly when the
  effective mode is `mailmoose_approval` (a `remote_draft` inbox has no in-app
  approver, regardless of kind). A domain inbox is preset to `mailmoose_approval`:
  `PUT /authoring` rejects `remote_draft` for a domain inbox with `400`, and the
  UI hides the mode selector and notify override for a domain inbox rather than
  offering them.

### Remote detection and approval (`internal/app/remote_worker.go`, `control.go`)
- `RemoteWorker` watches each remote-configured standalone inbox (IDLE with a
  bounded polling fallback), records exactly one durable arrival per genuinely
  new message, and emits a durable event before any fan-out. The first pass
  establishes a baseline without emitting, so enabling the watcher never floods.
  Both reads are bounded and correct on a folder larger than one search page: the
  baseline reads the true maximum UID with a newest-first single-UID search, and
  each incremental pass fetches the oldest new UIDs with an IMAP-native
  `(cursor+1):*` search (`SearchQuery.AfterUID`), never the whole folder and never
  the oldest page in place of the newest.
- **Event entity ids for remote mail are the arrival id, and the canonical read
  resolves it.** A remote arrival event's `entity_id` is the durable arrival id,
  which is deliberately distinct from the cached-metadata id (detection is
  independent of, and may run before, the metadata reconcile). The canonical read
  surface resolves an arrival id to its metadata row — materializing the row from
  the arrival's durable header fields when the reconcile has not yet run — so a
  client that follows an event straight into `GET /v1/messages/{id}` (or the
  common read) always resolves the message. An arrival whose recorded UIDVALIDITY
  has since changed cannot be resolved and reports `not_found`.
- A standalone approval control message is handled by
  `Service.HandleRemoteApprovalControl`, which matches the message's `From`
  address directly against the nominated approver plus the single-use token.
  There is no provider envelope attestation on this path; see the accepted risk
  in `SECURITY.md`.

## 4. HTTP / API (`internal/httpapp`, `internal/apispec`)

- `internal/httpapp/mailbox_access.go` is the single local/remote dispatch: it
  resolves an inbox to a `mailboxBackend` (`routed` = standalone/remote) and
  every `/v1` read/mutation branches on capability, never on a transport type.
- Common routes (`internal/httpapp/standalone_api.go`) return the shared envelope
  `{items, next_cursor, completeness, errors}` for folders, messages, threads,
  search and labels, on both inbox kinds.
- **Account-wide listings merge into one globally ordered stream.**
  `internal/httpapp/mailbox_merge.go` merges the local store with every
  authorized remote inbox into a single date-sorted page (not per-inbox
  concatenation). The opaque cursor (`commonCursor`) records each source's own
  native progress plus the **global stable key** (`<RFC3339Nano>|<id>`) of the
  last returned item, so a later page resumes each source strictly after its own
  progress and drops anything not strictly older than the global key — no
  duplicates, no gaps, even when items interleave across sources or share a
  timestamp. The per-source key is the message/thread **id** (not a timestamp),
  because a timestamp is not unique and would drop same-second siblings on the
  next page. A source failure is recorded per-inbox and never fails the page.
- **Search and filtered lists continue correctly under local filtering.**
  Because the remote source cannot express every local filter (notably
  `has_attachment`), the merge and the scoped remote list pull successive raw
  pages until enough matches are collected or the source is exhausted, resuming
  from each returned item's own native cursor (`SearchRemoteResult.NextCursor`
  for search; the metadata id for a list). They never stop at the first
  filtered-out window, so older matching mail is not hidden behind a page of
  non-matches. When a bounded scan reaches its per-request page cap without
  finding a match, it carries a **scan continuation** (`commonCursor.Scan`, or the
  returned `next_cursor` for the scoped list) so the next request resumes deeper
  instead of silently omitting a match beyond the cap. Completeness is `partial`
  whenever a remote source participates or a failure occurs.
- Routes are registered in `internal/httpapp/server.go`; the API reference is a
  generated artifact (`make docs`) and `tests/unit/apispec` guards its counts.
  The external-alias UI/API/routes/schemas are removed with no compatibility
  shim.

## 5. Known limits (report, do not paper over)

- **Progressive backfill, with a 500k UID snapshot ceiling.** Ordinary large
  folders are backfilled to `complete` over successive passes via the persisted
  per-folder cursor; the 2000-message batch is a per-pass bound, **not** a
  permanent cap. The one hard ceiling is `remoteUIDSetCap = 500000`: a folder
  whose complete UID set exceeds it is indexed newest-window-only, prune is
  skipped, and it stays `partial` (never falsely `complete`). Do not describe a
  status that is `partial` as complete.
- **Remote bodies are transient, and the common GET has no offline fallback.**
  Only header/thread/folder metadata is cached. A body or attachment is fetched
  live per request and never archived; if the connector is unreachable the common
  single-message GET answers `503` rather than serving cached metadata as the
  body.
- **Shared/Other namespaces are excluded, and an empty-prefix namespace is
  conservative.** A personal scope never reaches the server's Shared or Other
  namespaces. On a server with no discoverable personal namespace the scope falls
  back to the explicit root (`INBOX`) and its children, so a top-level sibling
  requires setting an explicit root — see the setup note in §1.
- **Provider Trash expiry is the provider's concern.** The local retention
  sweeper touches only locally-persisted messages; a remote Trash folder's
  server-side expiry is never swept locally.
- **Deployment policy for `RemoteSecurityPlain`** is enforced by the runtime
  layer, not the model: the standalone UI warns before a plaintext binding is
  saved (on the create dialog and the connection-settings page), plain is never
  auto-selected, and a connector never downgrades at runtime.
